This is a little project I worked on last days.
It is HTML/CSS/JScript based, created from blank, and simulates a 1/2player game
of Wheel of Fortune.
Each player has 3 spins and at the end, the player with higher score wins the game.
P.S: It's totally random (theoretically), so you can play it with your friends to
decide who drinks the next shot :) I don't encourage you to drink, it's definitely
not safe for your health! Stay healthy!
